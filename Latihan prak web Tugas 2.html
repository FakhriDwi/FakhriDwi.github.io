		Doing your research and thinking about the home page structure before you even start sketching ideas 
		is of paramount importance to the design process. As you do your research, make sure you’re focusing 
		relentlessly on your potential customers’ first impression. After all, designing a business website that 
		provides an excellent user experience is next to impossible without knowing the target users’ expectations.
		And a website that doesn't pay attention to accessibility, or lacks great user experience, has a much less 
		chance of attracting a decent volume of traffic after all, UX and SEO go hand-in-hand. There are outliers 
		with careless UX still attracting tons of users.
